###  This document contains the features that we will code for each version of the Space Travel Calculator.  

0.0 --> # Comment with program info (name, date, version) and author info. 
0.1 --> print() instructions
0.2 -->  input() user_name and print it to the screen. 
0.3 --> # Units of Measurement (million, billion, trillion) 
0.4 --> # distances_in_solar_system, multiply by unit of measurement. (All distances in Km) 
0.45 --> # distances_out_of_solar_system, multiply by unit of measurement. (Add light_year converter) 
0.5 --> if/else statement to select distance.  
0.6 --> Enter speed, if/else statement to verify less than speed of light. 
0.7 --> Calculate amount of time to travel in seconds, rounding to nearest whole second 
0.75 --> Calculate number of days of travel and then years of travel, rounding to nearest whole day
0.8 --> Use if/else statement to check if travel time is  less than or equal to three years. (use 365 days each year)
0.85 --> If less than or equal to three years, print() statement of success, otherwise print() statement of failure
0.9 --> Add while() loop so the code runs continuously until the user quits.  
1.0 --> Final version, all code works correctly.
